SwingChromecast
===============

Swing client to interact with your chromecasts.
This implementation is purely the frontend, it uses [Vitaly Litvak's
API](https://github.com/vitalidze/chromecast-java-api-v2), which is an implementation
of the ChromeCast V2 protocol. 

However, since the library is pulled from Maven you don't need to have it locally to run this
client. (Provided you fetch it from Maven).
